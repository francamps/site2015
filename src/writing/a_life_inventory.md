I don't generally celebrate my birthday. Although I enjoy other people's parties, I feel self-conscious throwing a party for myself, and don't tell anyone. Some people remember sometimes, and it's nice, but it tends to go quite unnoticed, which I'm totally ok with. I'm actually enjoying getting older, but throwing a party for myself doesn't feel representative of what I feel when ```myAge++```.

I do, however, tend to find meaning in rituals and I like stories, and since I'm turning 30 now, I've been telling people about it a bit more than normal.

Also, I've had a blast in my 20s. The decade has been really good with me, and I've been blessed with all sorts of adventures and experiences, too many to enumerate here.

So instead of celebrating my 30th birthday, I felt like celebrating my 20s. Instead of celebrating by receiving a party, or by receiving presents, and since at this point I have people scattered all over the world, I decided to celebrate by doing a bit of a life inventory.

The idea was to go through a list of all the people who have impacted my life in one way or another, and send a letter giving thanks. It feels much more correct to celebrate by thanking people who've made my 20s happen than thanking myself for, huh, existing?

It's been an interesting exercise. I couldn't write to _everybody_, it would have been a monumental task. I tried to be honest with myself and write not only to people who I really felt like celebrating together, but also to people who I felt a bit uncomfortable with, people who did impact my life even when I did not impact theirs in any meaningful way. 

And finally, I wrote a letter to my nephew to be kept unopened until the day he turns 20, or November 11th 2033, with some of the lessons I've learned during these 10 amazing years.

Life is good.
