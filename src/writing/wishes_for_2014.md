* Adopt "joy and kindness" as my motto.
* We'll hear a lot more about B Corps.
* We'll collectively stop using the expression "change the world" in tech when it's not accurate. In case you're hesitating, it's most likely not.
* We will all make an extra effort to simply not have an opinion about how should anybody live her life.
* Some new music will be amazing. 
* New companies will get me as excited as Kickstarter, Twitter or Kiva did a few years back.
* We'll be extra vigilant to point out when our behavior is reinforcing any type of discrimination.
* Gender issues and sexism will see a real involvement from men.
* What's really not part of the sharing economy, but rather the renting economy (I'm looking at you AirBnB), will be called so and the actual sharing economy will be left alone. Just to be clear, AirBnB is totally awesome, but it's just not called sharing if you're paying.
* Some company will emerge that challenges Apple and I'll be able to reduce my absolute dependency to their products.
* We will stop finding "tuna" under "vegetable sandwiches".
* The Spanish state will stop sucking big time and start behaving like a 21st century democracy good enough for European standards.
* Tech media will start doing actual journalism and stop doing free publicity for the big players.
* We'll stop talking about Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald and actually start talking about privacy and accountability.
* We'll collectively stop using the word "hipster".
