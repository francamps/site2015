1. New York is NOT an hedonistic place.

2. New York does sleep. Quite a lot, actually.

3. New York is the ultimate accelerator of careers and passions.

4. If you can live without partying until the next morning, number 3 might be worth staying.

5. You’re by yourself. You’ll realize you’ve been guided all your life. You’ll get enormous satisfaction in building your own narrative.

6. You’ll be judged on what you do, on what you bring to the table. Own it, and you’ll find happiness in doing that, and maybe a sense of purpose you lacked before.

7. Your intimacy is yours. It is not expected that you share things that are truly personal. It is embarrassing and you will not get the feedback you expect. Your problems are yours and you’re expected to deal with them on your own.

8. Guys and girls are not friends. If you’re going to a show, get a coffee, eat together, have a drink or talk about something together, that’s a date.

9. You should buy yourself a bike as soon as possible. Not having to take the subway will change your life.

10. Never take it personal and move on.
