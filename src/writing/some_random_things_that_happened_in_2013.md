I
* Met my nephew when he was 2 hours old. Such a trip.
* Randomly ran into people in Mexico City.
* Met incredible artists in New York, New Orleans, Minneapolis.
* Survived a week of trash collectors strike in Madrid.
* Experienced a syndrome of Stendhal in Minorca. Again.
* Missed my first flight, in Minneapolis.
* Danced off a snow blizzard in Brooklyn.
* Started training capoeira seriously again.
* Fell off my bike twice.
* Started using Backbone.js.
* Turned 29.
* Moved from Bedstuy to Bedstuy, stayed in Bedstuy, loved Bedstuy more than ever.
* Read books not written by Roberto Bola√±o.
* Saw the sun going down behind Manhattan dancing on a Brooklyn rooftop with a bunch of adorable human beings and I get goosebumps just by remembering how beautiful it was.
* Saw a bear in the wild at like 15 feet from me.
* Had a water pipe explode in the middle of the night in my room in Brooklyn and flood the whole thing.
* Met beautiful unicorns and incredible people from all over the world.
* Attended Eyeo, Visualized and ITP Camp and get mesmerized, inspired.
* I ditched a suitcase full of clothing on an airport because they were gonna make me chose between rebooking (and repaying) or boarding without luggage. Yes, it was Delta. 
* Built a spandex screen where you could pretty much literally touch visuals, on openFrameworks.
* Took things less personal. Will still be working on that one in 2014.
