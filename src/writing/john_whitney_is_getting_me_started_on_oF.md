John Whitney was considered one of the fathers of computer animation. His early work is almost purely mechanical, literally, and he set the foundations for more digital work later on. Most of his stuff is slightly psychedelic 

At an animation workshop at SFPC on openFrameworks with [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/), we've reviewed some of Whitney's work and taken it as inspiration for some experiments. Since I'm exploring particle systems and swarm behavior, this is a piece I was looking into.

And here's a still of the original I was trying to replicate.
