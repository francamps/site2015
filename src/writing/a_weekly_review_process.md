I'm implementing a personal weekly review process to help manage projects I'm working on, keep a log of ideas and delegate things out of my head, because I basically say yes to *way* too many things. I'm literally scheduling time for this. To start, I'm putting 2h 30min a week.

This is based on a conversation with and an idea by [Ida Benedetto](http://uncommonplaces.com/about-ida-benedetto/).

## Process

* Monitor the projects you are working on.
	- List what you're working on. 
	- Review, update, throw on to backlog remove.
	- Detail tasks
	- Allocate time for documentation
	- What can I open-source about what I'm making?
	- Note personal goal on each of these projects (including actual work work)
	- Keep a log of where projects stand. Are all of these really simultaneously manageable?
	- Keep a three phase list
		+ 1 - This project will get work this week
		+ 2 - This project is in a planning phase
		+ 3 - This project is in a completely speculative phase. It may happen, most likely not.
* Keep your ideas in check.
	- 10 min brainstorm: what have you been thinking on this last week? All sorts of ideas, personal, professional and all.
* Clean up after yourself, in both the physical and digital worlds.
	- Clean your mail.
	- Make sure email is at 0 too.
	- List things to do IRL: DMV, presents, etc.
* Manage mid-term calendar
	- Review your calendar - What's happened in the last two weeks?
	- Review your calendar - What's happening in the next three weeks?
* Review your work process
	- Review the review process
