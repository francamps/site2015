I've been looking for excuses to learn Arduino for a long time. My common regular work has barely anything to do with the physical world, and I am not an engineer, so I've been putting it off for an indefinite amount of time. 

After seeing some of his projects and expertise, I asked [Andrew Kleindolph](http://www.extrasleepy.com), an interaction designer and technology teacher I've had the pleasure to meet at SFPC, for some ways into it. 

Here are some resources I'm looking into right now.

+ [Do these starting with lesson 1](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-arduino)
+ [Connecting Arudino to Processing](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing)
+ From the main Arduino site: 
	- [Guide](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)
	- [Tutorial](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage)

+ And here's a [good book](http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Cookbook-Michael-Margolis/dp/1449313876/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1413298471&sr=1-5&keywords=Arduino).

For more advanced stuff, [this one](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1557) seems to work great.

Now it's only a matter of finding good stuff to do with it.
