The first few weeks at the School for Poetic Computation have been overwhelming with awesomeness. There was a moment last Wednesday, two weeks in, when I felt very heavily saturated with new inputs and ideas. I started feeling some anxiety trying to find the balance between learning and production, between learning and theory and capacity to execute. Or even understanding what I wanted to get out of it.

Part of the difficulty of that is the added handicap of never been to art school or fully pursued a purely artistic intention or exploration in my projects in such an open ended way before. This has me dealing with unlearning certain types of mental processes, being unsure about the ways I should pursue some of these problems.

I exposed this to some of the students in the school, and was happy to discover that it was not an uncommon feeling. It seems that this is part of the process, to go through all of these doors being open, all these new constructs to make and struggle your way through their digestion.

By the end of the week, [Sara Hendren](http://ablersite.org/about/) came to give a talk at the school. She is an artist and researcher who works at the intersection of design and engineer, and does a lot of work on communication and journalism, generally around the idea of assistive technology. She has a strong thesis that I think is well summarized by the motto _all technology is assistive technology_, which is the title of a popular post she wrote (but I can't find now, I promise to update when I do).

She had an incredible capacity for precise, explanatory and very powerful language, which may be a consequence of the complexity of the issue she's taken as central to her work and how identity and language are a strong factor into how that topic is perceived. She presented a lot of projects that explored topics of her own research and interests, and the way she framed the questions that these projects were looking to answer really resonated.

I had a short chat with her the day after, and this became especially clear. After the chat, I felt that I was asking questions about what I was looking for, asking the questions that resonated with me in a way that allowed me to have a framework of reference by which to prioritize work and filter inputs. It's given me a direction of exploration. I feel I have a powerful tool in my hands that I can use to guide myself. It's now a matter of correctly framing the question and materializing it into specific rules that guide my creation and learning. I'm waiting to have that question better framed to explore some of this ideas more in depth in this blog.
