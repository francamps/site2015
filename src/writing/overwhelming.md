Today I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. By awesomeness, but definitely overwhelmed. At SFPC, we've been in touch with so many ideas, experiences, languages, that it is already all a bit difficult to absorb and process.

The hard part for me is not only that, but the fact that absorbing all these new inputs has my mind flying around like a butterfly from idea to idea, without really committing to any of them.

Maybe that's what it's supposed to be. I can acknowledge the value of focusing on learning, processing, exercising around a whole lot of ideas, getting your mind trained into thinking and reflecting about all of this. There is a whole lot of value I'm already feeling on thinking about systems in a playful, creative way. I find myself _unlearning_ the way I usually think about projects, and it feels very inspiring.

However, I feel a little anxious when I see my mind wandering so much and can sense the possibility of not even _producing_ anything solid at the end that I can present to myself as a tangible output.

I've been trying to list out what was realistic to expect from SFPC in those terms, and was not.

**Unrealistic**
+ Get proficient in any new language.
+ Produce one, two, three pieces of middle complexity to show, when you've never actually worked in that context.

**Realistic**
+ Get in touch with a whole lot of languages.
+ Learn to think conceptually about computing, about programming.
+ Get a hang of other angles to this (experience design, performance art, installations).
+ Produce a couple of proof of concepts of realms you never actually produced anything for.
+ Do a lot of writing.
+ Document artists, tools, career paths.
+ Make honest, intersting, genuine connections.
