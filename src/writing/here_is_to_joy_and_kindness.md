<i>This is just a ride.</i>

And this one has been amazing. This one has been one of those of being close to the core of the mystery of life. 

You have all been part of this. Some of you, because you're so deeply entrenched into what my life is, that my life would just not be a thing without you. Some of you, I just recently met and I may know very little about you. But I still have a big deal to thank.

Those who just touched my life represent the largest, most beautiful mystery of what it means to be human. 

The fact that there actually is a 'us'. There is a 'all of us' that we all feel in some hidden corner of ourselves.

You may think you aren't doing anything altruistic. But you are. You are bringing on your most limited resources, your energy, your time, your space, your youth, smiles, creative energy. You acknowledge joy and other people's happiness, you acknowledge and promote togetherness. You have the belief that increasing that is a noble endeavor worth being pursued, the endeavor to make life a wonderful adventure and this world one worth living in.

You have made me smile, dance, work, talk, think, travel, wonder, kiss, have sex, watch, read, write, draw.

You have made me feel excited, loved, valued, marveled, challenged, lucky, excited, dumb, listened to, guilty, smart, confused and happy.

And this means you believe in joy. You believe in kindness. You believe that we collectively decided to make this world a better place.

For that, I thank you from the deepest corner of whatever it is that makes me me.

Keep on loving.

And bring on 2014.
