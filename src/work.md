	In parallel, I explore digital contexts artistically. I like experimenting with repurposing some online communities, and trying to understand what makes collective intelligence and action emerge.

	All of these projects are investigations I worked on during the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io) Fall 2014 session. SFPC is an artist-run school working at the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention and based in New York City.

	* [A blog that travels the world on Craigslist looking for surprise and misunderstanding.](/projects/Traveling with Craigslist/index.html): When I started at SFPC and had no idea what I would be working on, I decided to at least write a lot about my thoughts and experiences. But after a few weeks, thinking about communities and repurposing of technologies and connection, I started posting anonymously in faraway and isolated sections on Craigslist’s boards around the world.
	* [A decade's inventory](/projects/A decade's inventory/index.html): The least computational of my projects was in fact not originally associated with SFPC and it was a personal endeavor in which I worked just on the side. At some point I realized that it was related to the idea of connection and biographies, some of the questions I’m exploring here too, so I decided to include it. 
	* [Twitter Random Walk](/projects/Twitter Random Walk/index.html): A twitter bot that unfollows twitter accounts and follows some of these accounts followees, slowly alienating my twitter experience by following strangers’ interests and breaking out of my filter bubble.
	* [Moop](/projects/Moop/index.html): Still a work in progress, I’m working on a pong game that will be played by as many people simultaneously as possible. It is designed as a homage to an experiment by Loren Carpenter in 1991 where 600 people in the real world played a pong game simultaneously.
