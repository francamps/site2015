            <p>When I leave New York, and I’ll find that new place for me, eventually I’ll look back at you in search of inspiration. And I’ll ask that memory to empower me, like you used to do with me.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>When I leave New York, I’ll think of you and the density of talent that I could meet in a weekend, the impossible stories, your diversity of faces and goals, and ways of loving, ways of aspiring, a diversity so deep that is invisible, like there are no patterns.</p>
<p>When I leave New York I won’t remember how hard you were with me in the first days, how hard you are with your kids, how hard you are with those confused, with those who hesitate. I’ll remember how a feeling of rejection can be transformed into individual freedom and confidence, how everything is subjective and nobody really knows how to live.</p>
<p>When I leave my New York I’ll remember the excitement, the extremes, I’ll remember the obsessions, I’ll remember your photogenia and your vanity, I’ll remember your streets full of delusional dreams. I’ll remember your tough lessons, and how they worked, and I’ll see myself losing steam at times, and I’ll think of you and regain energy to keep going. ‘New York would not let me stop now’, I’ll tell myself.</p>
<p>When I leave New York I’ll remember how relationships were so volatile and I’ll try to imagine what it would have been like to be a single girl in New York.</p>
<p>When I leave New York, I will remember what it means to be hungry to do more, to go higher, to learn faster, what it means to be hungry for creation, for starting up, and what it means to be in the quest for something. I’ll remember what it means to be alone with your story to be written.</p>
<p>When I leave New York, everything will move slowly for a while, and I’ll remember my years with you as a fast sequence of snapshots, faces and places, and parties, and opportunities, and people to admire, and fucking assholes, and money, and weird-ass situations, and crazy people with nobody to help them, and my bike, and your smile on the subway, and hot coffee in a snowy winter Thursday, and dancing next to Gowanus canal on a sunny summer Sunday.</p>
<p>When I leave New York, I’ll remember the most important lesson you taught me: that everything is just another story, and you only need to tell it right.</p>
