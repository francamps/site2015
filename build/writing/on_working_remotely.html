            <p>I recently finished a project that set a milestone in my work life. From start to finish, from the moment I planned the idea to the moment I sent the final version of it, I didn’t see a face of the people I was working for. I was working from New York for a crowdfunding site named Goteo, that operates in Spain. Besides how engaged with the project I felt, working remotely has been an incredibly interesting experience, and has helped me reflect about the nature of work today and possibilities to come. I’ll do more of it.</p>
<p>Goteo is a crowdfunding site based in Spain, but it’s decentralized across the country. The team is formed by people working from Mallorca, Barcelona and Bilbao and decentralization is part of their DNA. They are incredibly passionate about what they do, and their plan is to create nodes of the site that operate autonomously from different locations and can have a better handle on local projects. They’re soon to add new nodes in Sevilla and Madrid. So it was the right type of organization to start en endeavor like this.</p>
<p>It worked so great that it made me think about what can be improved of the usual ways of working. Why are we so attached to a certain location when thinking about work? There are a whole lof of engineering and creative projects, and even some managerial tasks, that can be at least as well handed remotely as they can be on site. And especially in technology and some forms of art, there is no reason any more to keep forcing people to move from city to city every time they get a new job or start a new project.</p>
<p>For most of the projects at Knewton, we use collaborative tools that can be used from anywhere. GitHub, Google Drive, JIRA, Confluence. Most of the communication around projects happen via email or chat, even when collaborators are in the office. Communication is critical for every collaborative project (was I not being obvious enough?), but I would say that some of the collaborative tools we use may actually increase the effectivity of communication beyond the effectivity of physical meetings in some aspects.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying physical meetings are not important. Some ideas are better discussed in person and some meetings really do push projects forward. But, let’s face it, most don’t, especially after the definition phase. When the roadmap is clear, stop talking and start moving, and communicate about facts, not about ideas. There are more productive ways to merge ideas and lead discussions, keep each other accountable can work better with tools specifically designed for that purpose. Just think of applying version-control to every part of the design, building and implementation of a project.</p>
<p>For companies, allowing their employees to work remotely means a bigger ability to attract talent anywhere, and adapting better to the needs of their most valued workers. For employers, a more flexible situation means having access to a larger landscape of opportunities and being able to lead a life more adjusted with each one’s needs and aspirations.</p>
<p>From the human perspective, being able to work remotely can improve your productivity substantially, but also your quality of life. It allows you to have the schedule that better suits your own rhythms. I’m an extremely morning person (I know, right?), and not having to go to work until 9 or 10, and having to stay beyond 7 does not really work for me. Why would I waste my most productive hours?</p>
<p>In addition, it allows you to work from anywhere where your work is better, be it a coffee shop, a co-working space or home. My ideal choice is a coffee shop. I hate isolation, and I love the feeling of other people working in different things around me. A co-working space would work great, I assume, I’ve just never tried it. I don’t like working from home, but I know a lot of people do.</p>
<p>Of course, there are complications. There needs to be a clearly stated process for accountability, and an effort from all parts to keep very, very active the communication channel. The isolation factor doesn’t really work for everybody and some projects need a constant interaction. Also, some creativity processes need people to interact with similar inputs and ideas constantly. Generating new and useful ideas means putting together a lot of partially shared unfinished thoughts and reactions to the same inputs. This is difficult to mimic without physical interaction, but it is compensated by the easy access to more creative inputs from other sources.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I was living in Berlin and met a Canadian programmer who had just arrived to the city. He had just moved from Colombia, where he had spent some time living, and was planning to stay for a few months in the city. He had been working the whole time for employers that were never based where he was. That struck me so bad I promised myself to try at least to go in the same direction. It looks like it’s taking some time, but I’m getting slowly closer.</p>
<p>Working remotely does not mean that it doesn’t matter where you are working from. If I was not in NYC I would not have met the people I’ve met, I would not have come across certain opportunities and would have certainly made decisions differently. Where you physically are matters especially because you’re going to be in touch with ideas you would not see otherwise. It makes you interact with different mind sets, which is always good creativity.</p>
