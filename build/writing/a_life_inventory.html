            <p>I don&#39;t generally celebrate my birthday. Although I enjoy other people&#39;s parties, I feel self-conscious throwing a party for myself, and don&#39;t tell anyone. Some people remember sometimes, and it&#39;s nice, but it tends to go quite unnoticed, which I&#39;m totally ok with. I&#39;m actually enjoying getting older, but throwing a party for myself doesn&#39;t feel representative of what I feel when <code>myAge++</code>.</p>
<p>I do, however, tend to find meaning in rituals and I like stories, and since I&#39;m turning 30 now, I&#39;ve been telling people about it a bit more than normal.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve had a blast in my 20s. The decade has been really good with me, and I&#39;ve been blessed with all sorts of adventures and experiences, too many to enumerate here.</p>
<p>So instead of celebrating my 30th birthday, I felt like celebrating my 20s. Instead of celebrating by receiving a party, or by receiving presents, and since at this point I have people scattered all over the world, I decided to celebrate by doing a bit of a life inventory.</p>
<p>The idea was to go through a list of all the people who have impacted my life in one way or another, and send a letter giving thanks. It feels much more correct to celebrate by thanking people who&#39;ve made my 20s happen than thanking myself for, huh, existing?</p>
<p>It&#39;s been an interesting exercise. I couldn&#39;t write to <em>everybody</em>, it would have been a monumental task. I tried to be honest with myself and write not only to people who I really felt like celebrating together, but also to people who I felt a bit uncomfortable with, people who did impact my life even when I did not impact theirs in any meaningful way. </p>
<p>And finally, I wrote a letter to my nephew to be kept unopened until the day he turns 20, or November 11th 2033, with some of the lessons I&#39;ve learned during these 10 amazing years.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
