            <p>I’ve interacted with work culture in several countries, but strongly interacted with it in three: Spain, Germany and the US, via their least representative cities, Barcelona, Berlin and New York.</p>
<p>New York is the least hedonistic of these places, and it’s not even close. First let me tell you that I love New York and I’m very thankful for a lot of things I’ve learned here. Hedonsim is not the only school of thought I enjoy, and so this is not supposed to be offensive. It’s just a fact.</p>
<p>Let me tell you why I think so.</p>
<p>By hedonistic I mean a place where people’s behavior is driven by pleasure, the sooner and more intense the better. Hedonism can be moderate, for example, when slowly spending your afternoon walking by your neighborhood with friends from coffee shop to book store, lie on a park, talk about life and so on, or more extreme, for example, anything related to club culture, drugs, uncommitted casual sex and other fun stuff.</p>
<p>New York does not thrive in neither. Of course, you can do any of those things, but the city is not configured so that leading any of those activities is easy nor status-increasing.</p>
<p>First of all, the city is optimized for work. You just have to take a look at the subway system to realize that subways are specifically designed to take people from where they live to work and back (from the outer boroughs to Manhattan and back, but not within borrough).</p>
<p>Second, there is a judgmental attitude about what you do with your life, what you work on, why you are interesting, and this pressure make people work harder than elsewhere. People that don’t have a clear professional goal are continuously sanctioned in conversations.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong financial pressure. The fact that everything is expensive and difficult makes you want to make more money and if you’re not Warren Buffet, you’ll basically do that by working. More.</p>
<p>There are some aspects of hedonism that are present. Relationships are more volatile, so meeting new people is a constant. Making new friends is easier, but relationships are more superficial. This adds a notion of hedonism, but subtracts from the fact that deeper layers are never reached.</p>
<p>One common response that people have to counter the idea of NYC as non-hedonistic is the fact that you can get anything you want at any time you want. You can get Korean-Mexican food at 430 am on a Tuesday. That’s true. But that’s a commodity, and I consider commodities to be external to happiness, not a symptom or a part of it. That said, you can’t probably get a lot of your friends together at 430 am on a Tuesday because they work the day after (and we all have those important meetings) and also they live in the Upper West Side or Williamsburg and you’re in Prospect Heights and it’s not worth the trip. Solution: order Korean-Mexican food to make yourself happy.</p>
