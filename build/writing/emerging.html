            <p>Reading Jo Freeman <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/tyrstruct.html">&quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot;</a>, portions of Alexander Galloway&#39;s <em>Protocol</em> and other texts on decentralization, hierarchies and power structures for <a href="http://allisonburtch.net/">Allison Burtch</a> workshop at SFPC, I think about recent democratic uprisings and the genesis of social movements that we&#39;ve witnessed in recent years and their struggle with finding an articulate structure appropriate for the challenges of now.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/structureless.png" alt="Sturcturelessness"><em>Structurelessness</em></p>
<p>After the 2008 financial crisis, the economical policies implemented by political bodies to &quot;mitigate&quot; the effects of the crisis (as if it was some sort of weather disaster) revealed deep gaps in democracy quality in a lot of countries. These policies had specific effects in the south of Europe. In the case of Spain, these policies were heavily intertwined with steps taken by the political and business elites to maintain their position as <em>extractive caste</em>.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a wave of technological social tools has been readily available for those movements that sprung after the crash.</p>
<p>Galloway&#39;s <em>Protocol</em> is a good resource to understand TCP/IP protocols on the Internet as this illusion of a horizontal, leveled field in communications where the individual hosts self-organize and hierarchical power structures of the past are no longer applicable.</p>
<p>Analogously, communication tools have provided an illusion of structurelessness and horizontality in social and political movements emerging in the recent times that can act as a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>These movements (Tahrir, 15M, Occupy) that gained relevance after the crash found themselves with a power for organization that could easily outdo the articulation of their discourse. An ongoing challenge they had to overcome was precisely the right structure that would allow this articulation and some capacity for execution without compromising equality principles that characterized their existence.</p>
<p>One of the powerful ideas on Freeman&#39;s writing is that collectives can <em>not not have a structure</em>. If there is no defined structure and process to question it, the movement is abandoning itself to an informal sturcture that replicate non-explicit power dynamics between members, which tend to be fertile field for demogagocial and brute-force sequestration of the movement. Revolutions that go awry tend to fail here, when the uprising outpaces the articulation of a functioning structure.</p>
<p>Movements like the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, the 15M Movement in Spain or OccupyWallStreet in the US spent a significant amount of energy and resources in defining the structure of their own movement as well as the articulation of a common discourse.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/informal_structure.png" alt="Informal sturcture"><em>Informal structure</em> </p>
<p>I got somewhat involved in the 15M movement when I could go, and followed very closely from distance and participated when I could online. I also followed OWS quite closely. In the Spanish movement, the lack of political experience of a big part of its participants made the need for debates around structure much more explicit. In parallel to political debates, and attempts to articulate specific demands around a common discourse, the debate around structure, leardership and collective decision-making processes in the movement was (and still it) one of the most active. Some of these, particularly in Spain (with the PAH, Guanyem or Podemos), have chrystalized in new political entities that embody this constant readjustment and questioning the right balance between structure and equality.</p>
